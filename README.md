A work in progress.

This is a USB-C daughterboard for keyboards with a 4-port USB 2.0 hub on it (2 USB-A, 2 internal facing connectors on JST SR connectors), based around the Microchip USB2514 IC. 

Many thanks to:
* The [C3 Unified Daughterboard](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard) project, form which this daughterboard was based off of 
* The [Nanohub Project](https://hackaday.io/project/20790-nanohub-tiny-usb-20-and-30-hubs) - the USB2514 schematic was partially referenced off of the 4-port USB 2.0 design 

This is available open-source under the CERN OHL-W license and uses the [Acheron library](https://github.com/AcheronProject/AcheronLibrary). 

This project has not been tested yet.
